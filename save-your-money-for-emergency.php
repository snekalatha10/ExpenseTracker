                <h2> Here are some of the Best tips to save your money for Emergencies.</h2>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Set up several smaller savings goals, rather than large ones</h2>
                <p> Set yourself up for success from the start. Reaching that first goal can give you the motivation to keep going for further goals. Set your second goal and third goal as higher and higher. By then, saving will become a habit, and reaching the smaller goals will help you propel towards the larger ones.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Start with small, regular contributions
                </h2>
                <p>Set your initial saving level at a relatively small amount. It will ensure that you don’t stress about your cash flow, and it’ll make it too easy for you to rationalize your saving routine. Choose the amount,  whether it’s 5 or 500, and commit to saving it at regular intervals as per month, per week, or per month. The key is that it needs to become a habit, not a struggle.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Automate your savings
                </h2>
                <p>The best and easiest way to <a href="home">save money</a> is never to touch it in the first place. Set up a separate account just for the emergency fund and make the amount to be deposited automatically.
                </p>
                <p>Use a different type of account that you can’t easily access, unlike a normal account and there’ll be no chance you are going to miss it. And don’t watch the balance of that account continually,  that will only make you lay a hand on that amount.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Don’t increase monthly spending
                </h2>
                <p>Once savings became automatic, then don’t be lulled into a false sense of financial security and let spending creep up again, that’ll make deeper trouble.
                    <br> <blockquote class="blockquote">For example, if you gave up a new pair of shoes every month only to replace it with a  new increased monthly shopping list, this leads to an increase in spending money.
                </blockquote>
                Having an adequate emergency fund is critically important to your financial well-being. Being realistic is very important, but try to reach your ultimate saving goal as fast as you can.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Don’t over-save your Money
                </h2>
                <p>To say it more accurately, don’t devote too much of your savings or money to your emergency fund. An emergency fund is cash you can access quickly only in an emergency. You should stop contributing to that Emergency Fund account once you’ve reached your ultimate goal. Start depositing into an account where it will start earning money on its own, where it’ll be very fruitful.
